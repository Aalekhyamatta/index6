<h1 align='center'>CHILD LABOUR POLICY</h1>
<p>
    <b>
    Children are a valuable asset for any society. They constitute a very large segment of our population. As per 2011 Census, the persons below the age of 14 years account for 29% of the total<br><br> population while persons between the age group 14-18 years account for another 10% of the total population. The child's natural place is at school and the playground. However many children are <br><br>
        unfortunately denied these basic development opportunities in childhood. They instead get burdened with work because of poverty, irregular income streams for the family, economic shocks,<br><br> ignorance, lack of access to social security, education, health facilities, food security etc. The 2013 World Report on Child Labour prepared by the ILO has observed that child labour can<br><br> compromise the productive capacity of workers during adulthood and thereby constrain both national economic growth and efforts to reduce poverty.
    Recognizing that child labour is the outcome of<br><br> multiple causes and has multiple dimensions, Government of India enacted legislation (1986) and prepared the national policy on child labour (1987) to tackle the problem with a multi-pronged<br><br> approach.<br><br><h1>The important pillars of the national policy on the elimination of child labour have been as under:</h1><br><br>
    i) Legislative Action Plan--Strict and effective enforcement of legal provisions relating to child labour under various laws.<br><br>
    
    ii) Convergence of government developmental programmes – Focus on converging various developmental initiatives to alleviate poverty, provide access to social security, health and education,<br><br> economic and social empowerment of the child workers and their families.<br><br>
    
    iii) Project based plan of action – Implementation of National Child Labour Project Scheme (NCLPS) in the areas of high concentration of child labour.<br>
